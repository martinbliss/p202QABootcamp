## Use Yarn to Install App Dependencies

(from the source directory on your machine)

```
yarn install 
```

## Open Cypress

```
npx run cypress open
```

## Cypress Test Runner

The previous command should have opened a new window showing all the tests available. These tests should be grouped by app. You can click on individual *.spec.ts files to run tests per page. You can also use the test runner to run all tests at once.
